# Water-And-Caustics
For the purpose of this project, we wanted to render a realistic simulation of an underwater scene. In particular we wanted to implement the behaviour of light in water which includes reflection, refraction, and also study how caustics are formed and simulated. We were inspired by Evan Wallaceâ€™s WebGL Water for the project as well.
